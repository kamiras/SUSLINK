## Requirements

**Python 3.9 (64-bit)**

Python 3.9 also does need the following modules:

- requests
- json
- sys
- urllib
- time

**PHP 8.0.6**

**SUSLINK** also works in different versions of PHP.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/kamiras/SUSLINK.git
```


```
pip install requests
pip install urllib3
```

## Usage

To work with **SUSLINK** you need to execute the proyecto.php file. You cand drag all the files of the project and leave it in your **localhost/** directory. Or you can drag the directory of **SUSLINK** and leave it in your **localhost/SUSLINK/**.

In case of copying all the files to your main directory you would have to search:
```
http://localhost/proyecto.php
```

In case of copying the directory of SUSLINK to your main directory you would have to search:
```
http://localhost/SUSLINK/proyecto.php
```
One additional think to say is that the project takes 40 seconds to analyze the link/domain. That is caused by the urlscan API, their API takes about a half minute to deploy the json code, once the json code is read **SUSLINK** process it with Python.
